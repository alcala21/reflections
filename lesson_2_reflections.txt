# How's the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
The staging area is where you put the files that need to be tracked. It doesn't necessarily have all the files from the working directory and repository. Furthermore, the working directory and repository are physical places while staging area is a virtual place where changes to your files are being tracked.


# What do you think it offers?
It offers a way to isolate the files that we are interested in tracking for a given commit, or working session.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can only add the files where I'm making changes.

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when you want to explore new features in your code, or when you want to fix a bug.
