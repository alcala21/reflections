# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use a remote repository when I need an external backup of my code, or when I'm collaborating with someone else on the development of my code.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would like to control when to synchronize the local and remote repositories. Also, someone else might add at new files to the remote repository that I wouldn't like to be pushed automatically to my local repository.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone of a repository on Github. A clone is an exact copy of a repository, and a branch is a label of a commit.

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows git to compare how ahead, behind, or out of sync my local repository is from the remote repository.

# How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without Git or Github, I would collaborate through sharing files via emails and/or usb drives.
It would be easier to keep a visual track of the previous versions, however, that would be overwhelming over time if there are many changes in the files.
